### Two Weeks, Two Trails: Conquering the Pyrenees from Summit to Sea

What if you could walk from France to Spain, with nothing but a backpack and a sense of adventure? And then, just for good measure, walk back from Spain to France along a completely different, sun-drenched coast?

That was the dream. And in August 2018, we made it our reality.

The Pyrenees aren't just a line on a map separating France and Spain; they're a world unto themselves. This spectacular mountain range is crisscrossed by two legendary trails: the GR10 in France and the GR11 in Spain. Thru-hikers spend months tackling their 900-kilometer lengths. We had two weeks.

Our mission: to craft a "greatest hits" tour of the Pyrenees, blending the raw power of the high mountains with the sparkling charm of the Mediterranean coast. It was two blissful weeks of stunning scenery, soul-satisfying food, and unforgettable moments.

### **Part 1: The Mountain Heart – France to Spain**

Our journey began in the spiritual town of Lourdes, where we witnessed the mesmerizing lantern festival at the cathedral before diving headfirst into the wilderness. A taxi dropped us at Pont d'Espagne (5,000 ft), the gateway to our GR10 adventure.

The first day was a masterclass in mountain majesty. For 8 miles, we trekked alongside the magnificent Mount Vignemale, its icy crown piercing a perfect blue sky, as we climbed toward Refuge Beysellance. The weather was our companion until, as we neared 9,000 feet, the mountains decided to put on a show. A magical white-out swallowed the path behind us, leaving us feeling like we were on the edge of the world, alone with the peaks. Seeing our refuge in the distance was a welcome sight!

*Refuge Beysellance*

These mountain huts, or *refuges*, are the lifeblood of the trail. Refuge Beysellance was basic, but after a long day's hike, sipping wine and sharing a communal dinner of soup and meat at 8,500 feet felt like the pinnacle of luxury.

The next day was a descent into the charming town of Gavarnie, with views that stretched into forever. In the distance, we could already spot the Brèche de Roland—the "Breach of Roland"—a mythic gap in the mountains we’d be conquering in a few days. The anticipation was electric.

No trip to Gavarnie is complete without paying homage to its Cirque. It’s hard to describe the scale of this natural amphitheater. Massive granite walls soar nearly 5,000 feet into the air, creating a panoramic spectacle that quiets the mind and fills the soul. We just sat, watched, and meditated on its immense beauty.

For a touch of pure magic, we took a side quest to **Pic Du Midi**. A cable car whisked us to the 9,439 ft summit, where a hotel and observatory are perched. Our room had a direct view over a sea of clouds and mountain peaks. The stay included a phenomenal dinner and a private star-gazing session at the observatory. Despite hearing it could be tricky for non-French speakers, the staff went above and beyond to make our night under the stars absolutely perfect.

Then came the main event: crossing into Spain. Our taxi dropped us at Col de Tentes (7,200 ft) for the lung-busting climb to Brèche de Roland. The reward? Standing breathless at 9,100 feet in a literal gap in the world, with France at our backs and Spain at our feet. It was spectacular.

The Spanish side was wilder. With confusing trails and a view of hikers on a precarious-looking ledge, we had to trust our gut. We picked a path, and after a bit of trial and error, found our way onto the GR11 and down to Refuge Goriz, our home for the night. Our final mountain day was a trek through the incredible Ordesa Canyon before catching a series of buses and trains that would spirit us away to the coast, ready for the next chapter.

### **Part 2: The Coastal Soul – Spain to France**

Arriving late in Figueres, the festive hometown of Salvador Dalí, we were greeted by a bottle of delectable Spanish wine. The mountains felt a world away. After paying a visit to the wonderfully bizarre Dalí museum, we headed for the coast.

Our starting point: the beautiful seaside town of Cadaques. Our plan was to walk the 70km back to France over four days. The Mediterranean humidity was a different kind of challenge, wrapping around us like a warm, damp blanket, but the coastal views were worth every drop of sweat.

We followed the trail from Cadaques to Llanca, and then to Cerbere, stopping for the night in each town. The route flirted with the end of the GR11 and the beginning of the GR10, symbolically linking our two journeys. Finally, we walked over the border into France and arrived in Banyuls.

 To celebrate, we treated ourselves to a meal at **Le Fanal**, a Michelin-starred gem that was worth every single step.

For our final day's hike to Collioure, we chose a cooler, mountainous route that took us past the Madeloc Tower. The clouds rolled in, but the sweeping coastal views were still breathtaking. Our journey culminated at the hotel **Relais des Trois Mas** in Collioure, home to *another* Michelin-starred restaurant, La Balette. It was the perfect, indulgent end to an incredible adventure. We were so busy eating, we forgot to take pictures!

This was a trip of incredible contrasts: the rugged solitude of the high peaks and the vibrant energy of the coast; the rustic simplicity of a mountain refuge and the exquisite artistry of a Michelin-starred meal. It was everything we hoped for and more. We highly recommend it!
